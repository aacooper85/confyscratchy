<h1>Confy Scratchy</h1>

<p>Confy Scratchy is designed to facilitate for small-group-discussion multiple-choice problems. There are two stages:
	<dl>
		<dt><b>confidence report</b></dt>
			<dd>For a question with N answer choices, each participant has a budget of N points to distribute among them. The score for that assignment is how many points were allotted to the correct answer.</dd>
		<dt><b>scratchcard</b></dt>
			<dd>The small group discusses the question and decides which answer choice to 'scratch' first. If this is correct, the score is equal to the number of answer choices. If this is incorrect, the group can scratch again, for fewer points. Eventually, the correct answer will be revealed.</dd>
	</dl>
<p>Once all the questions have been scratched, Confy Scratchy reports both the individual score (sum of scores on each question in the confidence report) and the team score (sum of scores on each question in the scratchcard).</p>


<p>In order to create a Confy Scratchy, use the Card Designer to enter the correct answers to your questions. You can add and remove questions, and you can add and remove answer choices. Then use the Share Card link or QR code to share your card with your participants.</p>
